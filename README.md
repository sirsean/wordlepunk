# wordlepunk

_wordle, but cyberpunk_

Basically, this project is the same as Wordle. It uses the same dictionary,
in the same order. It uses the original dictionary from before the NYT took
over the project and started editing the words.

The visual theme is more cyberpunk-y, insofar as the fonts and colors and
imagery evokes a certain vibe. If you're into it, great.

It also has a history of all the previous days' words which you can go back
and play. You can fill out your history and do the full archive to your heart's
content. The history becomes available only after you've completed today's
word.

Your history is stored to local storage in your browser.
